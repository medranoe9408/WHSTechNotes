Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

Since I've technically learned python before, so far, my experience has been mostly a refresher. In the past I've focused mostly on programming in Java, so relearning the syntax of Python and comparing that to the syntax of Java has been interesting. Additionally, Python is debatably smarter than Java, for example, you  have to specify a variable type, but in Python, it just knows based off of the input or the initialized variable from the programmer. Im sure this will mean more or something different as I progress in my course, but for now, I'm still starstruck by it. I also think its interesting how Python does division/ integer division. The "/" is an untrunkated number and to do integer division the way it would be done in Java by outputting a trunkated number is "//". I think this is very interesting because it never made sense to me that Java automatically trunkated quotient. I think these fundamentals will help me as I continue to learn more advanced programming concepts because I will be able to find more efficient solutions to programming tasks and in the real world it will come more natually.

For you, I think you did a great job making the instructions clear. If anything maybe having an in class tutorial kind of thing happen. For example, project the process onto the board and walk through it with the class. I understand this would prove to be difficult though given the students in the class, so the way you did it is the best way it could have been done. For me, the only challenge I encountered was navigating the website itself. I don't usually work with websites like Github, so it was difficult for me to get the hang of it.

Following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code because it allows you to complete the task in a way that is effective, efficent, and overall the result that is desired. When you are doing something, even if you don't realize it, you are following a set of instructions which allows you to have a result that is what you wanted or expected.

Computer science plays a big part of my life. I'm contantly on my phone on apps like instagram, facebook, messages, and even some games. These programs would not be available without computer science, this is one of the things that interested me in computer science in the first place. Without someone who knew how to code, these programs would not exist.
