Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

Since I've technically learned python before, so far, my experience has been mostly a refresher. In the past I've focused mostly on programming in Java, so relearning the syntax of Python and comparing that to the syntax of Java has been interesting. Additionally, Python is debatably smarter than Java, for example, you  have to specify a variable type, but in Python, it just knows based off of the input or the initialized variable from the programmer. Im sure this will mean more or something different as I progress in my course, but for now, I'm still starstruck by it. I also think its interesting how Python does division/ integer division. The "/" is an untrunkated number and to do integer division the way it would be done in Java by outputting a trunkated number is "//". I think this is very interesting because it never made sense to me that Java automatically trunkated quotient. I think these fundamentals will help me as I continue to learn more advanced programming concepts because I will be able to find more efficient solutions to programming tasks and in the real world it will come more natually.

For you, I think you did a great job making the instructions clear. If anything maybe having an in class tutorial kind of thing happen. For example, project the process onto the board and walk through it with the class. I understand this would prove to be difficult though given the students in the class, so the way you did it is the best way it could have been done. For me, the only challenge I encountered was navigating the website itself. I don't usually work with websites like Github, so it was difficult for me to get the hang of it.

Following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code because it allows you to complete the task in a way that is effective, efficent, and overall the result that is desired. When you are doing something, even if you don't realize it, you are following a set of instructions which allows you to have a result that is what you wanted or expected.

Computer science plays a big part of my life. I'm contantly on my phone on apps like instagram, facebook, messages, and even some games. These programs would not be available without computer science, this is one of the things that interested me in computer science in the first place. Without someone who knew how to code, these programs would not exist.

The career I researched was a Software Developers.Software Developers are tasked with creating and developing websites, programs, and other applications that run on computers or orhter devices. A strong background in computer programming is highly recommended, interpersonal skills in order to collaborate with others on projects and being detail oreiented to be able to juggle multiple aspects are also highly valued. A bachelors degree or higher in computer science, software engineering or a related field are usually preferred by employers. A strong foundation in programming languages and relevant technical skills gained through coursework or experience are also considered by employers, however there are opportunities to be trained in entry-level positions. With this career there are opportunities such as being a security analyst, project manager, DevOps engineer, technical leads, and much more higher paying and more experienced jobs. Additionally, with the wide array of things you learn over your career, the possibilities are endless. You could always start your own business or organization with the skills you have aquired and be the head of your own company or other project. This job aligns with my interests and goals in computer science because I want to be able to create things for companies and work on projects that will impact a wide demographic of people.
