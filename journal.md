Since I've technically learned python before, so far, my experience has been mostly a refresher. In the past I've focused mostly on programming in Java, so relearning the syntax of Python and comparing that to the syntax of Java has been interesting. Additionally, Python is debatably smarter than Java, for example, you  have to specify a variable type, but in Python, it just knows based off of the input or the initialized variable from the programmer. Im sure this will mean more or something different as I progress in my course, but for now, I'm still starstruck by it. I also think its interesting how Python does division/ integer division. The "/" is an untrunkated number and to do integer division the way it would be done in Java by outputting a trunkated number is "//". I think this is very interesting because it never made sense to me that Java automatically trunkated quotient. I think these fundamentals will help me as I continue to learn more advanced programming concepts because I will be able to find more efficient solutions to programming tasks and in the real world it will come more natually.

For you, I think you did a great job making the instructions clear. If anything maybe having an in class tutorial kind of thing happen. For example, project the process onto the board and walk through it with the class. I understand this would prove to be difficult though given the students in the class, so the way you did it is the best way it could have been done. For me, the only challenge I encountered was navigating the website itself. I don't usually work with websites like Github, so it was difficult for me to get the hang of it.

Following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code because it allows you to complete the task in a way that is effective, efficent, and overall the result that is desired. When you are doing something, even if you don't realize it, you are following a set of instructions which allows you to have a result that is what you wanted or expected.

Computer science plays a big part of my life. I'm contantly on my phone on apps like instagram, facebook, messages, and even some games. These programs would not be available without computer science, this is one of the things that interested me in computer science in the first place. Without someone who knew how to code, these programs would not exist.

The career I researched was a Software Developers.Software Developers are tasked with creating and developing websites, programs, and other applications that run on computers or orhter devices. A strong background in computer programming is highly recommended, interpersonal skills in order to collaborate with others on projects and being detail oreiented to be able to juggle multiple aspects are also highly valued. A bachelors degree or higher in computer science, software engineering or a related field are usually preferred by employers. A strong foundation in programming languages and relevant technical skills gained through coursework or experience are also considered by employers, however there are opportunities to be trained in entry-level positions. With this career there are opportunities such as being a security analyst, project manager, DevOps engineer, technical leads, and much more higher paying and more experienced jobs. Additionally, with the wide array of things you learn over your career, the possibilities are endless. You could always start your own business or organization with the skills you have aquired and be the head of your own company or other project. This job aligns with my interests and goals in computer science because I want to be able to create things for companies and work on projects that will impact a wide demographic of people.

Coding helps to improve problem solving skills by teaching you transferable skills like how to break apart problems, how to work with others, and how to find effective solutions, which are all important in problem solving. Understanding code may help you in industries that are not directly related to healthcare because you will learn various things that would be valuable to any employer in any field. For example, understanding code and training your brain to understand code can help you break apart other complex issues in other fields and become a valuable asset to anyone you work for. Coding enhances creativity and colaboration because as you work through issues and find solutions to coding problems, you must go through many different solutions before you find the one that works best which not only forces you to use critical thinking skills, but also to use your creativity to find helpful solutions. Collaboration is an important part of coding. For example, if you are struggling with something, you can ask others for help or use the people around you to bounce ideas off of which will be helpful in any field as team work is an important part of any job.

Artificial Intelligence is a rapidly progressing form of technology that is being used for a multitude of things, including education, healthcare, personal issues (asking for help doing every day tasks), etc. With this new use of technology, there are many benefits that come with it. When you ask AI how to do something, more often than not, it will break down the problem into easy to follow steps along with the concrete answer, which allows for learning. Learning is probably the biggest potential positive of Artificial Intelligence, with opportunities that are endless. Instead of having to sit in a classroom with a teacher, simply opening any artificial intelligence application and asking a question about a topic that you don't know about can lead to a development of skills that would not be possible otherwise.

With the election coming up, the way voting
The process of voting has changed a bunch since elections started, namely, the electronic voting proccess. Online voting and electric ballots have changed the way we vote and the level of accessibility to voting that is available. This electronic voting process exists because of the great mind of computer science. The people who came up with the systems for voting based it off of arbitrary beliefs that really mean nothing when you sit down and review the facts.

It is important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online so that no one tries to steal it or use it against you in any way. Steps you can take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like Github and social media remains secure are by refraining from sharing your passwords or other sensitive personal information and refraining from posting excessivly or about personal things. Yes absolutely, I have definetly posted things to social media that I can now realize are too personal. Now, I would refrain from doing that and probably only share that type of information in person with people that I trust. I can balance being open and collaborative in online spaces while still protecting my privacy by ensuring that I have set personal and professional boundaries so that sensitive information does not come up at all and when it does it is being used for approved things only.

So the current event that Im choosing is the election. The way that it related to technology, which we have been learning in class. The way this related to technology is the electronic ballot system. The election itself is considered rather important to American citizens, but there are a lot of people who cannot vote for a multitude of reasons. Electronic voting provides a solution to this. 

This electronic voting also provides solutions to other issues like isssues particularly pretaining to accessibility issues. For example, this solution can help with allowing for people to be able to vote at home or from remote locations even so far is to help with people with health issues who cannot be around a lot of people.

Technology has changed the way we grow, distribute, and purchase food by allowing us to be able to do those things with little to no interferance from other outside issues. Technology makes food more affordable during the holidays because an increase in technology could allow more food to be produced, and make food more accessible during the holiday season by allowing people to not have to leave and placing online orders and having delivery services. There are negative effects of relying on technology for our food supply, such as the probability that there could be a flaw or a bug in the way the two interfaces communicate. For example, if the customer orders food on an app, but the app doesn't communicate that properly to the supplier, then there is obviously a flaw and its an example of why we should not rely souly on technology for our food supply.

Chatbots and virtual assistants are changing the way we get answers and communicate/form our own thoughts and opinions. From the implementation of google Gemini and older things like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Echo Dot/Alexa there are so many ways that virtual assistants are helping us in our everyday life. Chatbots are also helpful especially as a way of customer service or online trouble shooting for a physical issue. What excites me about this technology is that it is so widespread and makes the creation and sharing of technology easier from remote locations. What concerns me about this technology is the ease that misinformation can be spread. If everyone is using these things and it is misinforming people now we have a whole society of ill informed people which is never good. Since I want to be a program developer, this technology is very helpful to people in that field because it allows us to correct bugs and write code that we might not have been able to before. This is not only a good thing though since it takes the collaborative nature out of the field. Ethically, this technology can be used to cheat or bypass previously implemented ways of honesty especially in academics.

Brainrot being the oxford word of the year is crazy. The times that I see brainrot, it is used mostly to describe either a type of media or a person who consumes that type of media. That specific type of media that numbs your brain is not healthy or beneficial and I think that the people who consume that much media or use the term in general need to work on finding a balance between their media consumption and actually living life. I think that the kind of media you consume is based on you, if you don't want to see negative things then you won't-- youll find ways to restrict it from your feed and block negative people. With that being said, I think that digital media has had a positive effect on my mental wellbeing given that when I see something I don't like or something that is more harmful than healthy for my brain I take action to keep it off my feed. "Slop" is a crazy word, but in my personal life and being that I am a highschool student, I hear it a lot. Words like that are simply distastful and that specific word, while it does connect to my experience with technology in 2024 but there is
